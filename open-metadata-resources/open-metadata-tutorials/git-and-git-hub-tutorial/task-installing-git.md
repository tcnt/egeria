# Installing Git on your local machine

**Git** is an open source version control system used to store and manage Egeria's files.
You need it installed on your machine to work with Egeria's git repositories stored on
[GitHub](https://github.com/tcnt/egeria).

You can check whether it is installed on your system by running `git --version` from the command-line.

Git can be installed:

- On MacOS, as part of the **Xcode** suite (running `git --version` will prompt you to install it if it is not already
installed).
- On Linux operating systems, by using your distribution's package manager (`yum install git`, `apt-get install git`, etc).
- On Windows, you should use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) Version 2 or above, install an appropriate Linux distribution, and follow
  the instructions for Linux.
