# Egeria Road Map and Destination

Egeria is a large project with many different activities
adding content to the project.   This page provides an overview
of the aims of the project and a reflection of where we are today.

Figure 1 shows the five layers of capability that
Egeria is aiming for.

Figure 2 steps into a little more detail and expands out the types of functions
found in each layer:

> **Figure 2:** Functions found in each layer of capability for Egeria

Follow the links for more information about the functions shown in the three layers:

* [Governance Solutions](governance-solution-functional-detail.md)
* [Education](education-functional-detail.md)
* [Integration Platform](integration-platform-functional-detail.md)
* [Developer Platform](developer-platform-functional-detail.md)
* [Deployment Resources](deployment-resources-functional-detail.md)

## Understanding the road map

Figure 3 shows an overview of the status of the functions in Egeria today.
Green means that
there is function that is either [released or technical preview](../content-status).
Orange means there is work going on and red means it is planned but not started.

This chart is being updated with each [release](../../../release-notes).

As you can see, some progress has been made on all layers.
However, since they do build on one another, most of the early work has
been focused on establishing the frameworks, connector APIs and other
services to provide the developer platform.
The developer platform provides the libraries and interfaces
to build connectors to integrate third party
tools along with the runtime to host these connectors and manage the
metadata exchange.

Today we have a robust platform called the
[OMAG Server Platform](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/omag-server-platform.md)
and the ability
to configure [OMAG Servers](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/omag-server.md)
that host specific types of connectors to third
party tools.  The initial focus was to enable third party metadata servers
to connect together in the peer-to-peer open metadata repository cohort.
This capability is delivered along with two repository connectors for the
following third party connectors:

* [IBM Information Governance Catalog (IGC)](https://github.com/tcnt/egeria-connector-ibm-information-server)
* [Apache Atlas](https://github.com/tcnt/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem)

Through 2020, our focus shifted to the integration platform as we added
[connector implementations](../developer-guide/what-is-a-connector.md) for popular third party
technologies and standards (see [connector catalog](../connector-catalog))
and built out the [ecosystem user interface (UI)](https://github.com/tcnt/egeria-react-ui) that
enables an organization to:
* configure OMAG Servers on OMAG Server Platforms
* visualize the open metadata types through the type explorer (TEX)
* visualize open metadata instances in a single repository or
across the open metadata repository cohorts that a server is connected to.
* visualize to cohort and query the operational status of the OMAG servers
and services operating in the open metadata ecosystem
* configure OMAG servers and deploy them to OMAG Server Platforms

The ecosystem UI makes calls to specialized REST services supported by a type of OMAG Server
called the [View Server](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/view-server.md).  The view server is new for 2020 and enables the REST APIs
to the UIs to be deployed in a DMZ and the metadata servers to be behind an
additional firewall.  It also takes much of the load for supporting
end users off of the metadata servers.
  
In 2020 there was also support for a new type of OMAG Server called the
[Integration Daemon](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/integration-daemon.md).
This server supports integration services
that can host integration connectors
dedicated to exchanging metadata with specific third party technologies.

2021 has a focus on governing metadata.  There is a new OMAG Server called
the [Engine Host](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/engine-host.md)
that runs metadata discovery engines and governance engines.
These are supported by new [Access Services](../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services) for governance.

Support for the governance solutions naturally
follows along, building on the two lower levels.
The governance solutions themselves complement specific metadata and governance
solutions available in the market today.  Egeria is focused on filling in the gaps to
support individuals that are setting up and running an open metadata ecosystem and wish to
take advantage of the enterprise perspective it beings.

The first solution is **Historical Lineage Exploration**.
This was made available as a tech preview in late 2020.
This provides a user interface for finding assets and viewing their lineage
along with a dedicated governance server called the
[Open Lineage Server](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/open-lineage-server.md).
 
Next will be the Subject Area Management solution closely followed by the others
in 2021 and beyond.
