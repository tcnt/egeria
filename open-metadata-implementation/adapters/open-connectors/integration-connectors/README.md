# Integration Connectors

The integration connectors are responsible for exchanging metadata with third
party technologies through the [Open Metadata Integration Services (OMISs)](../../../integration-services).
They run in the [Integration Daemon](../../../admin-services/docs/concepts/integration-daemon.md)
OMAG Server.

An integration connector implements the specific connector interface from the integration
service that matches the metadata needs of the third party technology.
For example, the [Files Integration Connectors](files-integration-connectors)
catalogs files located in a specific directory of a file system.
They implement the integration connector interface of the
[Files Integrator Open Metadata Integration Service (OMIS)](../../../integration-services/files-integrator).

The database connectors are located in a separate git repository called 
[https://github.com/tcnt/egeria-database-connectors](https://github.com/tcnt/egeria-database-connectors)
to isolate the specific code dependencies that these connectors bring.
